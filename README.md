# FileTransfer_Drill

This is a File Transfer program done as a series of drills through the Tech Academy

The purpose was to create a script that would check a directory for new and recently edited files
(done within the last 24 hours), and move only those files to another folder where they could be sent
to the 'home office' once daily.

*The filemove purpose (to be written in version 2.7):
Write a program that moves 4 .txt files from Folder A to Folder B 
and print transfer path of each moved file to the shell.

*The mvNewEdits purpose (to be written in version 2.7):
Write a script that determines whether files in Folder A have been created 
or edited within the last 24 hours and if so, move them to Folder B

*The GUI purpose (to be written in version 3.x):
Develop a GUI for users to run file-transfer script easily & with more versatility. 
User must be able to browse to source and destination folders and manually initiate 
'file check & transfer'
(Written and tested on MacOS Sierra v10.12.3)

*The DB purpose (to be written in version 3.x):
Add database table using sqlite to file transfer program/GUI that records and displays 
date and time for each daily file check and transfer, and changes time period of file check
to be since the last file transfer.
(Written and tested on MacOS Sierra v10.12.3)
